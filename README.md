# EV_charging_stations

This repository contains code that is used in analysis of the distribution of electric vehicle charging stations largely in NYC but also in other large cities in America. 

## Key Notebooks:

1. EV_socioecon_impacts.ipynb : original development notebooks containing all attempted analyses (less clean than some others but contains a good amount of experimentation)
2. EV_Socioeconomic_Impacts_Refined_Analysis.ipynb : cleaned version of the above notebook on NYC data that contains all analysis included in slides summarizing this work.
3. street_data_explore.ipynb : notebook for processing street/ highway data for use int he NYC analysis
4. other_cities_analysis.ipynb : contains initial data read, processing and some preliminary analysis of EV charging stations in other large cities beyond NYC
